2. Install Node.js

3. Run
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

4. Run

If you have any questions regarding the assignment you can contact [lasse@bluebirdday.dk](mailto:lasse@bluebirdday.dk) with any questions.

Good luck! ðŸ™‚

### Requirements
1. On the [/](/) route create a list of accordions displaying the information from the public API https://reqres.in/api/users. If needed, you can query the information for a single user on https://reqres.in/api/users/{id}.

    There's no need to validate the response from the API, but please think about how you would do it, as we may discuss it at the interview.

2. Clicking on the user's first name will redirect the user to [/profile/{id}](/profile/{id}) where ID is the user's ID. 
The [/profile/{id}](/profile/{id}) page will show the clicked user's information.

3. Use Next.js for routing, Chakra UI for components and styling and TanStack Query for querying the API.

4. Push your changes to your repository and get ready to present your code at the interview by sharing your screen.
